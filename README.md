This project stems from a personal interest in the data analysis of prescribing in Wales, particularly in how the implementation of new policies and guidelines has affected lidocaine prescribing levels in Wales.

Based on changes to the guidelines regarding lidocaine prescribing, a data analysis of lidocaine patch prescriptions was conducted. This analysis utilised data from the North Wales Shared Services Partnership (NWSSP) - NWSSP website.
